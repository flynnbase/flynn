The Flynn web dashboard now ships by default as part of every cluster, whether you use the managed launcher or install on your own infrastructure. The web dashboard lets anyone deploy and scale GitHub apps on a running cluster without ever opening a terminal window. 

We've started building Flynn every night, so all new installations get the previous night's build. 

Test coverage has also improved and continues to be a major focus.
## Changes

### Enhancements

- Nightly builds are working. ([#469](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/469))
- Scheduler tests are now integration tests. ([#186](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/186))
- Pinkerton is now a package, the binary is no longer included in the Debian package.
  ([#477](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/477))
- Request example generator for the controller. ([#473](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/473))
- `CONTROLLER_DOMAIN` and `DEFAULT_ROUTE_DOMAIN` have been replaced with
  `CLUSTER_DOMAIN`. ([#266](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/266))

- Buildpacks have been updated. The default OpenJDK is now version 8. ([#494](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/494))

  advantage of this. ([#495](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/495))
- Test durations are reported by [Flynn CI](https://ci.flynn.io). ([#443](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/443))

  correctly. ([#467](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/467))
- IPv6 nameservers are filtered out of the resolv.conf used in containers.
  ([#474](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/474))
- `flynn-host ps` no longer prints incorrect timestamps. ([#488](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/488))
- Environment variables are exposed to buildpacks properly during builds. ([#483](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/483))
