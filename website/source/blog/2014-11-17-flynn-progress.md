title: "Flynn Progress: Week Ending Nov. 17, 2014"
date: November 17, 2014

We smoothed out many rough edges in Flynn last week by removing some upstream dependencies. You'll see improvements to our security and stability, along with better support for GitHub releases.

## Changes

### Enhancements

- We [updated to Go 1.4rc1](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/468) to improve reliability and security. This may also improve performance as development continues.
- The router's `go-vhost` package dependency [was replaced](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/415) with the new `crypto/tls` functionality in Go 1.4.
- All Go [subrepo paths](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-announce/eD8dh3T9yyA) have been updated. ([#416](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/416))
- Vagrant VMs now use IPs from [RFC 5737](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737)
  for host communication to work around DNS rebinding protection and avoid
  collisions. ([#438](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/438))
- We added a `version` command to `flynn-host` that will show the release version or git
  revision that it was built from. ([#308](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/308))
- [We added a Makefile](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/435), so the `make` command should be used instead of calling `tup` directly. The `make clean` target replaces the `clean` shell alias.
- [Releases are now tagged](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/440) on GitHub.
- The `flynn-release download` command was moved to the `flynn-host`
  binary, and the `flynn-release` binary was removed from binary packages. ([#446](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/446))
- [Flynn CI](https://ci.flynn.io) now tests all supported buildpacks. ([#417](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/417))
- Bootstrap now supports [waiting for TCP services](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/417).
- The `flynn-bootstrap` command was renamed to `flynn-host bootstrap` and the `flynn-bootstrap` binary was removed. ([#449](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/449))

### Bugfixes

- Releases invalidate the correct CloudFront distribution. ([#451](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/451))
- We deleted our unmaintained Docker backend for the host daemon, closing out four Flynn issues. Support for Docker images remains a key feature of Flynn. ([#430](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/pull/430))

## What's Next

We expect to have nightly builds available shortly. We are focused on improving our test suite, documentation, and stability.
