title: Flynn Preview Release and Meetup
date: April 21, 2014
---

Today we're excited to announce the first preview release of Flynn!

There's still a lot of work to do but today's release lets developers start experimenting with Flynn and get a sense of what's still to come.

We would like to stress that Flynn is definitely not production ready. It shouldn't be used for customer-facing or critical services yet. We're working hard on stability, security, and performance, but there are certainly many bugs of which we are unaware (and a few we know about).

[Try it](https://dashboard.flynn.io) now or check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn) to get started with Flynn.

Flynn is an open source project and strongly encourages [community contributions](https://flynn.io/docs/contributing).

Our current focus is on stability. Until we have complete test coverage for all the major components and feel that Flynn is stable in production, we generally won't accept pull requests for new features.

We strongly encourage you to report any bugs or unexpected behavior and to help with test coverage and stability fixes. Check out our [contribution guide](https://flynn.io/docs/contributing) for more information on how to help out.

We will be hosting a [meetup](http://flynn-april-sf.eventbrite.com/) in San Francisco at 6:30pm on Thursday, April 24. We'll do our best to record the event for everyone who can't make it in person.

Questions and feedback are appreciated on [GitHub](https://github.com/flynnbase/flynn/issues), [IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/flynn) (#flynn on freenode), and the new [development mailing list](mailto:flynn@librelist.com).

Thank you all, especially sponsors for your patience and support. We'll keep working hard to make Flynn the best it can be!
